# Welcome! 

This document has the content that we will discuss in our first lecture of this Introductory course in R programming. I know a couple of folks have prior experience with R, so I'm going to give you the option of pursuing some fun programming tasks instead of listening to me lecture. If you finish the intermediate task before the lecture is over, you get a free pass on one primer of your choice. If you finish the advanced task before our next class, you get a free pass on one homework assignment of your choice.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Don't worry about this yet
# it just tells R to show code in the output document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

**For folks with some background in R** Try making this table using the `titanic_train` dataset from the `titanic` R package. You will want to use the `kable` function and `kable_styling` function in the `knitr` and `kableExtra` package, respectively, to get the aesthetics of the table right.

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

library(titanic)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(labelled)
library(geepack)
library(magrittr)


```


```{r, echo=FALSE}

readRDS('answer1.RDS')

```

**For folks with lots of background in R** Make this table using the `titanic_train` dataset from the `titanic` R package. 

No hints, have fun :)

The prevalence of mortality for passengers on the titanic, stratified by `Pclass`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

readRDS('answer.RDS')$wide

```

**For folks who are new to R, let's talk about**

# The tidyverse

You may have heard of the `tidyverse` if you have read or used R prior to this lecture. The tidyverse of a set of **R packages** that complement each other and make many common data-related tasks seem easy.

<br>

## What's a package?

A package is a set of **R functions** (and sometimes other types of files, such as a dataset) that can be downloaded to your system and loaded into your workspace using the `library` command. Once loaded, the functions in an **R package** are at your command until you close R.

<br>

```{r}


# Lets demonstrate by loading the tidyverse into this R session
library(tidyverse)


```


Notice how this command loaded several packages? Specifically, `ggplot2`, `tibble`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `dplyr`, `stringr`, and `forcats`. You can load any of these packages individually using `library` if you don't want to pull in the whole bundle. 

```{r}

library(tidyr)

```


**Your turn!**

In your R session, try loading the `tidyverse`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

So packages contain functions...

## Whats a function?

Now we are asking the right questions. 

- Shorter answer: every command in R is a function

- Longer answer: A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs. For example, the `mean` function maps a set of numbers into a single number, i.e., 

$$\text{mean of x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i, \text{ where x is a } n\times1 \text{ vector } $$

Let's see how this looks in R

```{r}

# Creating a vector in R

x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

# What did we just do?

# First, we used the assignment operator, <-, to create a new object named 'x'
# (note: you can name objects whatever you want, subject to format restrictions)

# Next, the concatenate function placed 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into a vector.
# (note: the assignment operator allowed us to assign this vector to an object named x)

# print the vector

print(x)

# R knows you hate typing print, so you can also just type the thing you want to print

x

# apply the mean function to x

mean(x)

```

<br>

**Your turn!**

In your R session, 

- create two vectors (name them `x` and `y`). 
 - Let $x = \left(1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \right)$. 
 - Let $y = \left(6, 7, 8, 9, 10\right)$. 
- What do you get when you run `x + y`? 
- How about `x / y`?

# The Titanic data

*Housekeeping notes:*

1. First homework is assigned today (5/14), due next Tuesday (5/21)
2. Second primer is assigned today, due on Thursday
3. Explaining rstudio cloud lectures/homework projects
4. We will finish lecture 1 today and have first lab on Thursday.
5. Second homework will be posted on or before next Tuesday. 

Have you ever wondered if you would have survived as a passenger on the Titanic? If so, you will probably enjoy this exercise.

## Importing

We can import the data by loading the `titanic` package. I'll also load the DT package so that we can use its function, `datatable`, to get a broad look at the dataset.

```{r}

# This package contains the data
library(titanic)
# This package has a nice function that lets us view the data
library(DT)

```

## Tidying

Tidying up messy data is one of the hardest part of data analysis. First of all, what do you name the data? I think it's best to use a short but descriptive name of each dataset in an analysis. In this analysis, I'm calling the titanic dataset ttnc. Notice how I just removed the vowels? (TiTaNiC). 

```{r}

ttnc <- as_tibble(titanic_train) 

ttnc


```

The data frame we just created is called a `tibble` (tidy table). It is a modern re-framing (get it?) of the standard `data.frame` object in R. We will use `tibbles` throughout the course and I will frequently just call them datasets. Do you notice a couple of columns in this dataset that we don't really need?

### Column selection using `select`

```{r}

# We are about to apply the select() function
# from the dplyr package. The select() function
# lets you pick columns by name from a dataset
# and create a new dataset with only the columns
# you indicated. 
# (lots more to say - we will come back to it)

ttnc = select(
  ttnc,     # the first argument of select is a data set
  Survived, # did this person survive?
  Pclass,   # ticket class
  Sex,      # passenger sex
  Age,      # passenger age 
  SibSp,    # no. of siblings / spouses
  Parch,    # no. of parents / children
  Fare,     # ticket price
  Cabin     # cabin no.
)

# Lets take a closer look at the data using 
# the datatable function (from the DT package)

DT::datatable(ttnc)

```

*Problem:* There is an old saying "women and children first." It means that in a time of crisis, aid is preferentially given to younger people and women. Survival rates from the Titanic can show whether that saying is a real behavior pattern or just something people say. First, we need a new column in the data that will indicate whether a passenger was an adult or child.

### New columns with `mutate`

```{r}


# First we need to make an indicator variable for children
# let's say the age-cut off is 18

ttnc = mutate(
  ttnc,
  life_stage = if_else(Age < 18, "Child", "Adult")
)

DT::datatable(ttnc)

```

### Grouped summaries with `group_by` and `summarise`

To see whether particular groups of people were more likely to survive compared to other groups of people, we can look at the average survival rate in each group. Let's consider six groups:

- Male aged 18 or older
- Male aged less than 18
- Female aged 18 or older
- Female aged less than 18
- Male, unknown age
- Female, unknown age

We will group the dataset into these categories using the `group_by` function in the `dplyr` package.

```{r}

# A grouped dataset explicitly indicates the groups when its printed
ttnc_grpd <- group_by(ttnc, Sex, life_stage)

print(ttnc_grpd)

```

Next, for each group, compute the proportion of individuals who survived.

```{r}

# Did you think a for-loop was coming?
# That was a good guess, but we have an easier way
# The summarize function in dplyr can apply a function to each group,
# and then return a tibble containing the summary statistics

srv_rates <- summarize(
 ttnc_grpd,
 prop_survived = mean(Survived)
)

```

This isn't a bad table, but it could be spruced up a little. For example, the `prop_survived` looks like it could be a little neater. Let's make that column show percentages instead of probabilities, and round the percentages to 1 decimal using `mutate`.

```{r}

srv_rates <- mutate(
  srv_rates,
  prop_survived = round(100*prop_survived, digits=1)
)

# looks better
srv_rates

```

So what if we want to spread this dataset out? Specifically, what if we want to show two columns, one for males, one for females, and put survival probabilities in those columns? To get our dataset into that kind of format, we'll use the `spread` function from the `tidyr` package.

```{r}

# spread is a function in the tidyr package
# (tidyr is part of the tidyverse)
# the arguments of spread are simply the key and value columns
# the key column contains the groups that will define new columns
# the value column contains the values that will be placed into
# the new columns. 

# There is an inverse function for spread called gather.

# There are more general versions of spread and gather 
# called pivot_wider and pivot_longer. We will return to
# this family of functions later in the course.

srv_tbl <- spread(
  srv_rates, 
  key = Sex, 
  value = prop_survived
)

srv_tbl

```

**Your turn!** Instead of grouping the data by sex and life stage, try grouping the data by sex and `Pclass`. Summarize survival probabilities by these two variables. What trends do you see?. 

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r}

ttnc %>% 
  group_by(Sex, Pclass) %>% 
  summarize(prop_survived = mean(Survived)) %>%
  mutate(prop_survived = round(100*prop_survived, digits=1)) %>% 
  spread(key = Sex, value = prop_survived) 
  

```


# Pipes (`%>%`)

Do you ever get tired of naming things? How about reading disjoint code? Maybe you don't like reading code that looks like this:

```{r message=FALSE}

# compute standard deviation of x by 'hand'

x <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)

sqrt(sum((x-mean(x))^2)/(length(x)-1))

```
 
 The pipe operator can address all three of these problems. Essentially, using the pipe, `%>%`, lets you send one argument into a function instead of explicitly writing that argument in the function call. Let's see how this looks.
 
```{r}

# Load the pipe package (magrittr)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(
  library(magrittr)
)

# These are equivalent

centered_x = mean(x)

centered_x = x %>% mean()

```

Multiple operations can be chained together using the pipe:

```{r}

# Multiple operations in standard R
ssq_x <- sum(x - centered_x)^2
var_x <- ssq_x / (length(x) - 1)
std_x <- sqrt(var_x)

subtract(10, 2)

# Multiple operations with the pipe
std_x <- x %>% 
  subtract(centered_x) %>% 
  raise_to_power(2) %>% 
  sum() %>% 
  divide_by(length(x)-1) %>% 
  sqrt()



```

Do pipes make code more concise? Sometimes, but definitely not always (*e.g.*, see above). Here is what pipes do: 

- Remove the need for unnecessary intermediate names (`ssq_x` and `var_x`)
- Create collective blocks of code instead of disjoint lines
- Create a "left-to-right" reading environment for code.

## Passing the dot

Sometimes you want to pass an object with the pipe operator, but the object is not the first argument of the function that you are piping to. For example, the function that fits generalized linear models in R (`glm`) takes a formula as the first argument and a dataset as the second argument:

```{r}

mdl <- glm(Survived ~ Sex, data = ttnc, family = binomial(link='logit'))

broom::tidy(mdl)

```

So if you wanted to pipe the `ttnc` data into the glm function, this would happen

```{r}

mdl <- try(
  ttnc %>% 
  glm(Survived ~ Sex, family = binomial(link='logit'))
)


```

What happened? 

- We passed `ttnc` into the `glm` function using the pipe. 
- The `glm` function expected `ttnc` to be a formula.
- We need to tell `glm` where the `ttnc` argument goes. 
- We can do that using the `.` symbol: 

```{r}

ttnc %>% 
  glm(Survived ~ Sex, data = ., family = binomial(link='logit')) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
  

```


## Reflexive pipes

There are a number of times when you want to modify an object. For example,

```{r}

variable_names <- c("a","b","c")

variable_names <- c(variable_names, "d")

variable_names

```
The reflexive pipe makes this syntax a little more compact:

```{r}

variable_names <- c("a","b","c")

variable_names %<>% c("d")

variable_names

```

**Your turn!** See if you can create the `srv_tbl` above in one fell swoop of piped operations, starting with the original `ttnc` object.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r}

as_tibble(titanic_train) %>% 
  select(
    Survived,
    Pclass,
    Sex,
    Age,
    SibSp,
    Parch,
    Fare,
    Cabin
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    life_stage = fct_explicit_na(
      cut(Age, breaks = c(0, 17, Inf), labels = c("Child", "Adult")),
      na_level = 'Missing'
    )
  ) %>% 
  group_by(Sex, life_stage) %>% 
  summarize(
    prop_survived = mean(Survived)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_survived = round(100*prop_survived, digits=1)
  ) %>% 
  spread(
    key = Sex, 
    value = prop_survived
  )

```
